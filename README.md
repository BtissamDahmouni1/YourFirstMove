Developing a chess game is a challenge which no one will
accept because it has strong and highly developed algorithms over the centuries of
time. It’s pretty challenge for myself to develop and implement all the algorithms but
my passion motivated me to accept this challenge and do as much as I can. “YOUR
FIRST MOVE” is the name of the application. I choose the name because it is the
name of the first book that I read about chess at the age of 13
