Developing a chess game is a challenge which no one will
accept because it has strong and highly developed algorithms over the centuries of
time. It’s pretty challenge for myself to develop and implement all the algorithms but
my passion motivated me to accept this challenge and do as much as I can. “YOUR
FIRST MOVE” is the name of the application. I choose the name because it is the
name of the first book that I read about chess at the age of 13

<h2>GUI Design of the application</h2>
In terms of User Interface design, I have handwritten all the user interface designing
with the help of inbuilt QT libraries such as QGraphicsItem. Since the UI is simple in
Chess games it feels me not necessary to use drag and drop .ui files which drives me
more complicated.

This Is how I made the structure of chessboard with 8 * 8 White and Grey cubes.

<h1 align="middle">Folder Structure</h1>
With the use of “Doxygen” I have listed my class hierarchy as follows,

And especially I have used Resource Collection Files (.qrc files) to store image files in binary format. This is useful because the application always needs this set of image files and its easy to load when we sore them as binary. Additionally, this will reduce the risk of losing any important files.
